### What the Reg Clock Means:
The QuantGov regulatory clock gives a daily-updated count of the number of words and restrictions in the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)](http://www.ecfr.gov/). The eCFR is continually updated and amended by the Office of the Federal Register and the Government Printing Office as administrative agencies finalize new regulation, allowing for up-to-date analysis of the regulatory code. The Reg Clock gives the number of individual regulatory restrictions---words or phrases that indicate a specific mandate or prohibition---and words are included in the most recent eCFR, and shows how long it would take a single person to read the entire Code as their full time job: 250 words per minute, 40 hours per week, 50 weeks a year. 

### How the Reg Clock Works:
This page is updated every day with word and restriction counts from the latest version of the [Electronic Code of Federal Regulations](http://www.ecfr.gov/). The data are obtained using the [ecfr corpus](https://github.com/QuantGov/corpus/tree/ecfr), which is built on the [QuantGov Platform](http://quantgov.org/platform).
