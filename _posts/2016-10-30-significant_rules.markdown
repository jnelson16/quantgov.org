### What this Tracker Tells Us:
According to [Executive Order 12866](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/eo12866/eo12866_10041993.pdf), a regulation is deemed “significant” if the action (1) is estimated to have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy, (2) will interfere with an action planned or taken by another agency, (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees or loan programs, or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues. This chart tracks the number of significant rules passed annually since 1996. Since these rules have a significant economic or legal impact, a large number of them in a single year can be troublesome.


### How this chart works:
The chart above pulls data directly from the [*Federal Register* web site](http://federalregister.org), which means that it is up to date as of the time you visited the page.
