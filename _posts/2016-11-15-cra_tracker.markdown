### Tracking Rules Subject to Congressional Review

Congress passed the Congressional Review Act (CRA) in 1996 in order to take greater control over the regulatory process. The CRA allows Congress to prevent a major regulation from taking effect by passing a joint resolution of disapproval introduced within 60 legislative days of the rule's publication. If the regulation is published within 60 legislative days of the end of a Congress, the countdown begins from the 15th legislative day of the next Congress. Because the resolution must be either signed by the president or passed over the president’s veto, the Act is rarely invoked in practice. In fact, the CRA has only ever been successfully used once to overturn a Clinton administration rule, during the early days of the George W. Bush administration.

The results of the 2016 election, however, mean that the president and both houses of Congress will be held by the opposite party of the outgoing president. This means the new Congress could pass resolutions of disapproval to be signed by President Trump. Depending on how many days Congress uses in its upcoming session, rules finalized on or after May 26, 2016 may be eligible for disapproval from the new Congress under the CRA.

The chart above live updates the number of significant rules published on each day of the CRA-eligible period. Significant rules are defined by Executive Order 12866, and while that definition differs somewhat from the definition of "major" rules under the CRA, significant rules are generally major as well. The searchable table below contains a live list of significant rules that are CRA-eligible. Click on the title of any regulation to go to its page in the *Federal Register*.  Choose from the drop-down menu at the top of the table to choose an adjournment date to show the significant rules published in the estimated CRA period if Congress adjourns on that date.
